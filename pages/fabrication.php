  			<h1>Fabrication Services</h1>
      		<p>For those in need of various historically themed <br />
      			items which look authentic, but are far more <br />
      			practical in terms of logistics and price, Loyalist <br />
      			Arms offers replica fabrication services. We have <br />
      			constructed many replicas of objects, from weaponry <br />
      			such as cannons, mortars (and once a crossbow, for <br />
      			some reason), to other items such as wagons, block- <br />
      			and-tackle, and various other period correct items. 
      		</p>
      		<p>We also offer services in set design for stage and film <br />
      			productions, or for static displays at historical sites <br />
      			or other organisations of interest. 
      		</p>
      		<p>Consider Loyalist Arms' fabrication services for your next <br />
      			project.
