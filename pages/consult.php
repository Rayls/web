  			<h1>Consultation Services</h1>
      	<p>The staff of Loyalist Arms can offer a wide variety of expertise <br />
      		in many periods of history, spanning from ancient times to the <br />
      		20th century. 
      	</p>
      	<p>We regularly offer our services as historical advisors to production <br />
      		companies and institutions. We can advise regarding period dress, <br />
      		speech, and lifestyle, and how these things affect both civil and <br />
      		military history.
      	</p>
      	<p>We are also experienced as Firearms Safety Advisors, having worked on <br />
      		a number of film and television productions to oversee the safe usage <br />
      		and handling of all periods and types of weaponry, from matchlocks to <br />
      		automatics, and from hand guns to artillery.
      	</p>
      	<p>Whatever historical needs you may have for your upcoming production/event, <br />
      		Loyalist Arms will be able to supply.</p>
      	<p>In 2011, Loyalist Arms was involved extensively with a documentary series <br />
      		named "M5: Weapons of War" which aired on Discovery HD. Below is a trailer <br />
      		for the episode entitled "The Arquebus" which predominantly featured <br />
      		Loyalist Arms.</p>
