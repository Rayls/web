		<h1>Swords</h1>
    <p>Spanning all eras from ancient to modern history, our swords
		are all <br /> hand-forged, with full-tang carbon steel blades, 
		allowing the swords <br /> to be fully "battle-ready" for demonstrations.
		Made with great attention <br /> to detail, they are able to withstand 
		sword-to-sword impacts and can  <br /> also take a keen edge.</p>
